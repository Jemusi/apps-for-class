# Personal Project
This is programming assignment 3 for CPSC221. We created an image compression application in C++ using a custom abstract data type called toqutrees, which are kinda like 4-arity trees. The images are "pruned" (compressed) to a certain tolerance, meaning the detailed colours over a region are replaced with the average colour over the region if it's within tolerance.
